# Arduino-Project-proximity_level

### Description

It's a tiny project where I use a LED bar and an ultrasonic sensor. The sensor reads the distance to the object, and the LED bar changes depending on the detected distance.

If the object is too far, the LEDs aren't going to be set, but as the object approaches, more and more LEDs light up.
